# Flappy-Bird

Tap the screen again to allow the ball to fly

The faster you tap, the higher you go

Once you stop, you drop towards the ground

Stay in the middle of the pipes. This is the main objective of the game. If you hit a pipe or the ground, the game ends

Find your rhythm for higher and lower pipes. This is important when you need to go higher or drop, or else you will hit a pipe

Try not to go high. You can still bump into a pipe
